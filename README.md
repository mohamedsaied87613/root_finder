# root_finder
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to compare and analyze the behavior of numerical methods studied in class {Bisection, False-position, Fixed point, Newton-Raphson, Secant}.
Description:
You are required to implement a root finder program which takes as an input the equation, the technique to use and its required parameters (e.g. interval for the bisection method).
Specification:
The program must contain the following features:
● An interactive GUI that enables the user to enter equations containing different functions such as: {poly, exp, cos, sin}. Reading from files must be available as well.
● Differentiation and Parsing is your task.
● A way to choose a method to solve the given equation.
● A way to enter the precision and the max number of iterations otherwise default values are used,
Default Max Iterations = 50, Default Epsilon = 0.00001;
● The answer for the chosen method indicates the number of iterations, execution time, all iterations, approximate root, and precision.
● Compute the theoretical bound of the error for the methods.
Marks Breakdown:
● Project Runnability.
● Results Correctness.
● Error Handling.
● Discussion. (individually marked)
● GUI.
● Report.
Report Content:
● Flowchart or pseudocode for each method.
● Data structure used and how helpful was your choice.
● Analysis for the behavior of different examples using the analysis template, and your conclusion about the behavior of each method (at least three examples).
● Problematic functions and the reason for their misbehavior and your suggestions (if they exist).
● Sample runs and snapshots from your GUI.
